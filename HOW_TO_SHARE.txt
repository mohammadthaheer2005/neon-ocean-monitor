# 🌍 How to Share Neon Ocean with the World

Follow these 3 simple steps to let anyone access your app.

## Step 1: Start the App (HOST)
1. Double-click **`run_neon_ocean.bat`**.
   - This starts your Streamlit server locally.
   - Keep this window **OPEN**.

## Step 2: Go Online (HOST)
1. Double-click **`share_online.bat`**.
2. A black window will open.
3. It will show you a **Tunnel Password** (e.g., `34.12.34.56`). **COPY THIS.**
4. It will show you a **URL** (e.g., `https://funny-cat-99.loca.lt`). **COPY THIS.**
   - Keep this window **OPEN** too.

### ❓ Which Link Should I Send?
- **Friend in YOUR House (Same Wi-Fi)**: Send the **Network URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.13:8501`).
- **Friend Anywhere Else (Different Wi-Fi/Mobile Data)**: Send the **Tunnel URL** (e.g., `https://funny-cat-99.loca.lt`).

## Step 3: Share (YOU -> THEM)
Send the **URL** (and **Tunnel Password** if using Step 2) to your friend.
